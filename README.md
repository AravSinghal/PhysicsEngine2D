# PhysicsEngine2D
A simple Physics Engine, made from scratch for fun and educational purposes!

# Objectives
This repo is mainly for an article that I'm writing for people who want to know how to write a physics engine from scratch.

# using PhysicsEngine2D;
This code is in C# and MonoGame.Net, but the same concepts can be carried on to any platform/language of your choice. For .NET coders, in the "Demo" folder there is a DLL named [PhysicsEngine2D.dll](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/blob/master/Demo/PhysicsEngine2D.dll) which you can reference in your project without having to rewrite the code. For an (untidy) example of how to use the physics engine, initialize bodies and so on, check out [Game1.cs](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/blob/master/PhysicsEngine2D/PhysicsEngine2DDemo/Game1.cs).
