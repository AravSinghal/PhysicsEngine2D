# PhysicsEngine2D
A simple Physics Engine, made from scratch for fun and educational purposes!

# Using PhysicsEngine2D
The physics engine library is made in C# and the demos are made with MonoGame, but the same concepts can be carried on to any platform/language of your choice. For .NET coders, in the "Demo" folder there is a DLL named [PhysicsEngine2D.dll](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/blob/master/Demo/PhysicsEngine2D.dll) which you can reference in your project without having to rewrite the code. For an (untidy) example of how to use the physics engine, initialize bodies and so on, check out the demos in the [Demos Folder](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/tree/master/PhysicsEngine2DDemo/Demos).

Feel free to contribute to the project!
