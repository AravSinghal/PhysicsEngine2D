# PhysicsEngine2D
A simple Physics Engine, made from scratch for fun and educational purposes!

# Objectives
This repo is mainly for an article that I'm writing for people who want to know how to write a physics engine from scratch.

# How 2.0
This code is in C# and MonoGame.Net, but the same concepts can be carried on to any platform/language of your choice. For .NET coders, in the "Demo" folder there is a DLL named [PhysicsEngine2D.dll](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/blob/master/PhysicsEngine2D/Demo/PhysicsEngine2D.dll) which you can reference in your project without having to rewrite the code, but I would recommend you do not do so because of the *bad way I'm doing the drawing* of the shapes currently. For an (untidy) example of how to use the physics engine, initialize bodies and so on, check out [Game1.cs](https://github.com/AravSinghal/PhysicsEngine2D/blob/master/PhysicsEngine2D/PhysicsEngine2DDemo/Game1.cs).
